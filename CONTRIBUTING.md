### A little requirement
If you are going to contribute the video feature of this app, you need a YouTube API just for contributing purpose. Since I can't provide my YouTube API key, you can register at their website to get a free API key.

When you need to test YouTube video feature, fill your API key string at a required place in lib/common/youtubePlyr.dart.

When you create pull requests, don't forget to remove your API key in lib/common/youtubePlyr.dart so that other people will not be able to use your YouTube API without your consent.

However, if your contribution is not related to YouTube video feature, it is fine, you don't need a YouTube API.

### Code refactoring

You can refactor the codes. Improving to a better coding style that mostly follow possible best practices, and removing unnecessary and unused codes, really improve the codes' quality and maintainability.
