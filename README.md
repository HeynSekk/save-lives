# Save Lives

This is a mobile app that make people have First aids knowledges.

So what is first aid?

When someone encounter a severe injury,  like car accident and is bleeding severely, if the bleeding was not stopped, he could die even before the ambulance arrive. 

We have to give him the First aid of stopping the bleeding. Only if we did so, there would be a possibility that he can survive. 

First aid is the first thing to give to a casuality, making him relieve from pain and saving his live. We should perform first aid while waiting for the ambulance. This increase the probability that the casuality survive.

The primary goal of first aid is to prevent death or serious injury from worsening. The key aims of first aid can be summarized with the acronym of 'the three Ps':

Preserve life:: The overriding aim of all medical care which includes first aid, is to save lives and minimize the threat of death. First aid done correctly should help reduce the patient's level of pain and calm them down during the evaluation and treatment process.

Prevent further harm: Prevention of further harm includes addressing both external factors, such as moving a patient away from any cause of harm, and applying first aid techniques to prevent worsening of the condition, such as applying pressure to stop a bleed becoming dangerous.

Promote recovery: First aid also involves trying to start the recovery process from the illness or injury, and in some cases might involve completing a treatment, such as in the case of applying a plaster to a small wound.

It is important to note that first aid is not medical treatment and cannot be compared with what a trained medical professional provides.

So, what benefits can we get if we had the first aid knowledges?

According to a survey, commissioned by the British Red Cross,

More than 532,000 young teenagers have been left to cope with a drunken friend who was sick, injured or unconscious in the last year.

1/4 (25%) of young people have had to deal with asthma attacks.

1/3 (33%) of teenagers have had to cope with someone with a head injury.

1/5 (20%) teenagers have had to help someone who is choking.

This indicate that we may meet someone troubled with injuries.

According to ROSPA survey, when people faced with these emergency situations, 44% panicked and 46% simply didn’t know what to do.

In the survey’s most compelling statistic, 97% of young people, believed first aid education would improve their confidence, skills and willingness to act in a crisis.

Therefore, young people and kids should learn first aids to be able to act more confidently, skillfully, and willingly in cases of emergencies.

So if we had first aid knowledges, we won't see the people losing their lives just because of injuries. There were many people who lost their lives just because of not getting First aid when they seriously need it. 

A Red Cross survey showed a staggering 59% of deaths from injuries would have been preventable had first aid been given before the emergency services arrived. So having First aid knowledge can save many lives. It is worth learning.

These days, most people including me don't use to pay attention to health related knowledges and reading health articles. Therefore, this app is born to notify you to study a first aid everyday. Thus, we commit learning something valuable on that day. This app is a remainder of what is really important: health.

When you get bored sometimes, you can watch videos and read articles of First aids in this app. This would be fun and you would have learned a useful technique of first aid.
